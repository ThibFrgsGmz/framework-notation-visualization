# Framework Notation Visualization

This project was a test to have a WebApp to do some intuitive data visualization.

The data to visualize were the scores I gave to the various frameworks evaluated in my [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359602735_Space_Flight_Software_Systems_An_approach_to_understanding_their_Open_Source_Framework_Paradigm) based on quality attributes.

The technologies used are:
- Streamlit for the WebApp,
- Plotly for the graphics,
- Pandas/Numpy for data exploitation.
